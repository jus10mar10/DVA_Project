# üèéÔ∏è Formula 1 Tyre Strategy Predictor

This innovative tool leverages machine learning and data visualization to enhance decision-making in the high-speed world of Formula 1 racing.

## Overview
In Formula 1, tyre strategy is a critical component that can determine the outcome of a race. Selecting the optimal tyre compound under varying weather and track conditions is a complex task that teams face every race weekend. This project aims to simplify this decision-making process by predicting the most suitable starting tyre compound based on historical data and real-time conditions.
